## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Associate Professor of Practice (teaching professor) in the School of Natural Resources and the Environment (SNRE) at the University of Arizona in beautiful Tucson, AZ!

My background is in community ecology, specifically long-term dynamics of desert rodents at local and regional scales. I completed my PhD with Morgan Ernest in @weecology at the University of Florida.

Nowadays, my work focuses primarily on teaching data literacy and computational reproducibility at the general education, Natural Resources majors, and graduate levels. I also dabble in data science pedagogy and, occasionally, ecology.

On any given day (hour? minute?), I will describe myself alternatively as a wildlife ecologist, community ecologist, or a data scientist. Regardless, I'm always an educator.
